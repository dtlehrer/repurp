# repurp: Automated Drug Repurposing Exploration
##Overview
This project is the result of summer research and coursework at the College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University (CSB/SJU).  By taking disease names as input and outputting top potential pre-approved drugs for treatment, our goal is to create an automated drug repurposing program that does the following:
1. more quickly extracts disease-related data from growing biomedical databases
2. uses interconnected biomedical data to suggest top drugs for repurposing
3. produces comparable results to [manual drug repurposing studies](./KeyResources/Zhang_OmicsDataMining) 
4. reduces drug discovery costs
